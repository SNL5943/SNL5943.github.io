Hi,

My name is Sang Ngoc Le, you can call me Sang. I am a software engineer with a strong interest in projects requiring conceptual, analytical and safety thinking. I enjoy developing products that make life better with end user's experience in mind, from Industrial products to Mobility solution. As a team player has worked in both start-up and big tech company, I believe that solving problems in daily work is not the only goal, but sharing knowledge and helping others are also the keys that construct a better community.
